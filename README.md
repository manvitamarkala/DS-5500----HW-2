## Problem 2

### Choose and critique one of the visualization by one of your fellow classmates for HW 1 Problem 2 (distribution of income across countries and continents over time). Include a link to the original.

For the visualisations for distribution of income across countries and continents over time, I have looked into the graphs presented in:
https://github.com/Omairss/ds5500_hw1/blob/master/Homework1.ipynb

### Describe the visualization and how it is similar and/or different from yours. Is it easy to interpret? Does it effectively visualize what is being asked? Why or why not?

The visualisation consists of a heatmap of different countries across the world representing the trend of the income over the years. 
This visualisation is very unique and different from the way I have presented the graphs in terms of lines. Heat maps are interesting to interpret showing important areas in terms of the color coding(maybe areas of concerns/interest) . The abbreviated country names, and absense of the legend explanation makes it a little difficult to understand what extreme red and extreme blue indicates and which countries represent numbers. It would have been better to first show a comparison across continents and then a split within countries.

The second stacked line is a good thought in a way of showing the top to bottom countries that contribute to the income and their distribution over time. Again, a split with continent and country level and full names of countries would make the intepretation easier. Some of the countries have similar color coding due to a vast variety of legend values, which could be avoided if there were smaller subsets interms of income buckets or countries.

## Problem 3

### Choose and critique one of the visualization by one of your fellow classmates for HW 1 Problem 3 (relationship between income, life expectancy, and child mortality over time). Include a link to the original.

For the visualisations for relationship between income, life expectancy, and child mortality over time, I have looked in the graphs presented in :
https://github.com/karangm-dev/ds5500-hw1/blob/master/app.pdf

The visualisation consists of income, life expectancy, and child mortality trends and correlation graphs at an overall level and 
also at an individual continent level to analyse each continents relationship. The trends are similar to the way I represented by graphs to understand how each of the individual metrics is changing over time. Next the most interesting way
